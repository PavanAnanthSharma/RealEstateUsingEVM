# DESIGN PATTERNS
A Design-Pattern, whether in software architecture or engineering, or in Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology, is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. 


Some of the design-patterns employed within this decentralized application project are State-Machine, Self-Destruct, Fallback Function, Circuit Breaker, Auto-Deprecate, and other design patterns. However, the ones mentioned above will be further explained as follows: 


## State Machine Design-Pattern
Contracts often act as a state machine, where the contract has certain states in which it behaves differently and different functions can and should be called. A function call often ends a stage and moves the contract to the next stage (especially if the contract models interaction). It is also common that some stages are automatically reached at a certain point in time. The **Colony token weighted voting** protocol implements this design pattern to manage the poll state. In that protocol, Admins can only add poll options in the poll creation stage, and votes can only be submitted when the poll was active. The poll can only be resolved after the poll close time has been reached.


#### How it Works
In this **Real Estate Blockchain Decentralized Application** project, the *State Machine* design-pattern is implemented within the **EnlistmentToContract.sol** Smart Contract. It works by managing 2 enumerations **OfferStatus** & **AgreementStatus**, where all *Offers* and *Agreements* initiated within the contract must pass through different stages / statuses in an acquisition deal between the landlord and a given tenant. Here marks all the different stages for:


**Offer Statuses**
```s
enum OfferStatus { // CURRENT STATE OF ANY OFFER SUBMITTED FOR A PROPERTY
    PENDING,
    REJECTED,
    CANCELLED,
    ACCEPTED
}
```


**Agreement Statuses**
```s
enum OfferStatus { // CURRENT STATE OF ANY AGREEMENT REGARDING AN OFFER
    UNINITIALIZED, // internal
    PENDING,
    REJECTED,
    CONFIRMED,
    CANCELLED,
    LANDLORD_SIGNED,
    TENANT_SIGNED,
    COMPLETED
}
```


Some modifiers such as *offerInStatus* and *agreementInStatus* are used to ensure that both *Offers* and *Agreements* respectively are in specific stages / statuses before some functions can be called and executed.


## Auto-Deprecate Design-Pattern
The Auto-Deprecation design pattern is a useful strategy for closing contracts that should expire after a certain amount of time. This can be useful when running alpha or beta testing for your smart contracts. Remember that using timestamps such as the now keyword are subject to manipulation by the block miners in a 30-second window.


#### How it Works
In this **Real Estate Blockchain Decentralized Application** project, the *Auto-Deprecation* design pattern is implemented within the **RentToContract.sol** Smart Contract. It works by setting an expiration date in the constructor when the contract is instantiated. The expiration date is stored in the variable *contractExpired* and it represents the expiration date of the Renting contract between the landlord and the tenant. Therefore, the modifiers *isNotDeprecated* and *isDeprecated* are used in the contract's functions to ensure that tenants cannot pay rent once the renting contract is expired.


## Access Control / Restriction Design-Pattern
One cannot prevent people or computer programs from reading your contracts’ state. The state is publicly available information for anyone with access to the blockchain. However, one can restrict other contracts’ access to the state by making state variables private. Here's an example
```s
contract C1 {
 uint private internalNum;
}
```
One can also restrict function access so that only specific addresses are permitted to execute functions. This is useful for allowing only designated users, or other contracts to access administrative methods, such as changing ownership of a contract, implementing an upgrade or stopping the contract. It can be useful to restrict function access to owners, a more general admin class or to any stakeholder in the system.


#### How it Works
In this **Real Estate Blockchain Decentralized Application** project, the *Access Control* design pattern is implemented within the **RentToContract.sol** Smart Contract. It works in 2 ways; either setting the address of the previous Smart Contract that calls or instantiates the RentToContract.sol (in this case, it's the *EnlistmentToContract.sol* Smart Contract) as the owner, or just adding the address to an *admins* mapping, so only admin addresses can access this RentToContract.sol Smart Contract. The 2 corresponding modifiers, *ownerOnly* and *onlyAdmin* are used to verify all addresses trying to call this contract as being the owner or admins respectively.


## Circuit Breaker Design-Pattern
Circuit Breakers are design patterns that allow contract functionality to be stopped. This would be desirable in situations where there is a live contract where a bug has been detected. Freezing the contract would be beneficial for reducing harm before a fix can be implemented. Circuit breaker contracts can be set up to permit certain functions in certain situations. For example, if you are implementing a withdrawal pattern, you might want to stop people from depositing funds into the contract if a bug has been detected, while still allowing accounts with balances to withdraw their funds.


#### How it Works
In this **Real Estate Blockchain Decentralized Application** project, the *Circuit Breaker* design pattern is implemented within the **RentToContract.sol** Smart Contract. It works by setting the public state variable *circuitBreakerStopped* to *true* (however, it is set to *false* by default), and using the modifiers *stopInEmergency* and *onlyInEmergency* to break the execution of the smart contract when debugging it.


In a situation such as this, you would also want to restrict access to the accounts that can modify the *circuitBreakerStopped* state variable, maybe to the contract owner (such as *EnlistmentToContract.sol*) or a set of admins, using the *Access Control / Restriction Design-Pattern*.


## Fallback function Design-Pattern
In Solidity, a contract may have precisely one unnamed function, which cannot have arguments, nor return anything. Fallback functions are executed if a contract is called and no other function matches the specified function identifier, or if no data is supplied. These functions are also executed whenever a contract would receive plain Ether, without any data. 


#### How it Works
In this **Real Estate Blockchain Decentralized Application** project, the *Fallback function* design pattern is implemented within the **RentToContract.sol** Smart Contract. Here's a code snippet:


```java
// FALLBACK FUNCTION TO RUN WHENEVER THERES' SOME KINDA ISSUE ..
function () external payable { // NO function name, params, or return values ..
    // THIS FALLBACK FUNCTION WILL EXECUTE IF THE CLIENT CALLS A FUNCTION
    // THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN THIS CONTRACT (i.e. funct's identifier isn't defined)
    // CONTRACTS CAN HAVE ONLY 1 FALLBACK FUNCTION
    // AUTO'LY HAS A GAS LIMIT OF 2300, 
    // MAKE FALLBACK FUNCTIONS AS CHEAP AS POSSIBLE

}
```


## Self-destruct / Mortal Design-Pattern
Implementing the mortal design pattern means including the ability to destroy the contract and remove it from the blockchain. You can destroy a contract using the selfdestruct keyword. The function to do it is often called **kill()**. It takes one parameter which is the address that will receive all of the funds that the contract currently holds. As an irreversible action, restricting access to this function is important.


#### How it Works
In this **Real Estate Blockchain Decentralized Application** project, the *Self-destruct* design pattern is implemented within the **RentToContract.sol** Smart Contract. It works by the function **killContract()** which can only be called by the owner of the contract using the *ownerOnly* modifier. In this case, the owner is the calling *EnlistmentToContract.sol* Smart Contract.


## Fail early and Fail loud Design-Pattern
This design pattern involves creating a modifier or function which checks the condition required for the execution of a Smart Contract function as early as possible in the function body and throws an exception if the condition is not met. This is a good practice to reduce unnecessary code execution in the event that an exception will be thrown.


#### How it Works
In this **Real Estate Blockchain Decentralized Application** project, the *Fail early* design pattern is implemented within the **RentToContract.sol** Smart Contract. It works by using the modifier *validateAmount()* which uses the function **throwsErrorIfZero(num)**, which then ensures that any amount (rent payment) sent to the Smart Contract (within the *receiveMonthlyRent()* function) is greater than 0. 


# Conclusion
As seen above, those are the main design patterns employed within the project so far. However, there are other patterns that could potentially be added, like the *Speed Bump* or the *Withdrawal* patterns.


The **Withdrawal / Pull over Push Payments** design pattern in particular, will be a very good fit for this project. This is the pattern where the sender Smart Contract (the *EnlistmentToContract.sol*) wants to send ether to the receiver Smart Contract (the *RentToContract.sol*), and instead of instantly transfering ether, the sender exposes a *withdraw()* function and alerts the receiver to call it to receive the ether to be sent, so the sender just manages the ether balances for other Smart Contracts. This pattern can be used in this project, but only when the project is expanded to allow ether transfers between tenants and landlords.
